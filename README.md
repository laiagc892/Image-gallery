# gallery-XL
Back End project developed in the bootcamp with a classmate. It shows an image gallery where you can upload picture's url and edit or delete them. They are also sorted by date.

## To visualize:
* 1- Check if node-modules are installed.
* 2- Once they are, run the server writing "npm start" on the terminal.
* 3- Then, browse the localhost on the listened port and with the appropriate endpoint (http://localhost:3000/photos).
